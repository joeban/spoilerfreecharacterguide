# Spoiler-Free Character Guide - Context for Claude

## Project Overview
**Website**: spoilerfreecharacterguide.com  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/joeban/spoilerfreecharacterguide/  
**Purpose**: A fantasy/sci-fi book companion website that allows readers to track characters without encountering spoilers. Users select their current chapter and only see character information revealed up to that point.

## Content Strategy
**Priority System**: Series are prioritized for data completion based on estimated search traffic potential:
1. **Tier 1 (Highest Traffic)**: Popular ongoing series with active readership
   - Fourth Wing / Iron Flame (recent bestsellers, high search volume)
   - Throne of Glass (Sarah J. Maas - massive fanbase)
   - A Court of Thorns and Roses (Sarah J. Maas - extremely popular)
   - Hunger Games (evergreen popularity, new content releases)
2. **Tier 2 (Strong Traffic)**: Established series with consistent readership
   - Percy Jackson (Rick Riordan - continuous new readers)
   - Shadow and Bone / Grishaverse (Netflix adaptation boost)
   - Mistborn / Cosmere (Brandon Sanderson - dedicated fanbase)
   - Wheel of Time (Amazon Prime series)
3. **Tier 3 (Steady Traffic)**: Classic series with stable search volume
   - Harry Potter (already complete - evergreen traffic)
   - Lord of the Rings (already complete - classic status)
   - Dune (already complete - movie adaptations)
   - Chronicles of Narnia (timeless classic)
4. **Tier 4 (Niche Traffic)**: Specialized audiences
   - Stormlight Archive (complex, dedicated readers)
   - The Expanse (sci-fi audience)
   - Discworld (specific fanbase)
   - Foundation (classic sci-fi)

**Implementation Order**: Complete series in order of traffic potential, focusing on:
- Series with recent adaptations or new releases
- Series with active online communities
- Series commonly read by book clubs
- Series with complex character rosters that benefit most from our guide

## Tech Stack

## Data Structure (v2.0 - UPDATED)

### Overview
The data structure now separates **character appearances** (which chapters they're in) from **character knowledge** (what we learn about them). This provides accurate "In This Chapter" listings.

### Character Structure
```typescript
interface Character {
  name: string;
  aliases?: string[];
  appearances: number[];  // All chapters where character actually appears
  knowledge: Record<string, CharacterKnowledge>;  // Information revealed by chapter
}

interface CharacterKnowledge {
  revealedIn: number;  // Chapter where this info is revealed
  description: string;
  role: string;
  relationships?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

### Migration Status
- **Schema Version 1.0**: Legacy format using `tiers` with `appearsIn`
- **Schema Version 2.0**: New format with `appearances` array and `knowledge` object
- The site supports both formats for backward compatibility
- Migration helper available in `lib/migrationHelper.ts`

### Example Book Data (v2.0)
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "The Philosopher's Stone",
    "author": "J.K. Rowling",
    "chapters": 17,
    "schemaVersion": "2.0"
  },
  "characters": {
    "harry-potter": {
      "name": "Harry Potter",
      "aliases": ["The Boy Who Lived"],
      "appearances": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],
      "knowledge": {
        "1": {
          "revealedIn": 1,
          "description": "A baby with a lightning bolt scar...",
          "role": "Orphaned infant",
          "relationships": {...}
        },
        "2": {
          "revealedIn": 2,
          "description": "Lives under the stairs, has green eyes...",
          "role": "The Dursleys' nephew",
          "relationships": {...}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "recaps": {...}
}
```

## Updated Type System

### Key Types (lib/types.ts)
- `Character` - New structure with `appearances` array
- `LegacyCharacter` - Old structure for backward compatibility
- `CharacterKnowledge` - Renamed from `CharacterTier`
- `ProcessedCharacter` - Enhanced with appearance tracking
- Helper functions: `isNewCharacterFormat()`, `isLegacyCharacterFormat()`

### Spoiler Filter (lib/spoilerFilter.ts)
- Handles both new and legacy formats seamlessly
- `getCharactersForChapter()` now accurately shows who appears in each chapter
- `characterAppearsInChapter()` checks the appearances array
- `getCharacterKnowledge()` returns the latest knowledge available at current chapter

### Migration Helper (lib/migrationHelper.ts)
- `migrateLegacyCharacter()` - Converts old format to new
- `migrateBookData()` - Migrates entire book file
- `generateMigrationReport()` - Shows what needs manual correction

## Data Entry Guidelines

### Chapter Recaps (MANDATORY)
- **EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER must have a recap** - no exceptions
- Each recap should be 2-4 sentences summarizing key plot points without spoilers
- Recaps are stored in the `recaps` object with chapter numbers as keys
- Example: `"1": "Harry Potter receives his Hogwarts letter..."`
- Missing recaps will break the user experience

### Character Coverage (MANDATORY) 
- **EVERY NAMED CHARACTER must have an entry** - no exceptions
- This includes major characters, minor characters, and even briefly mentioned characters
- Characters with single mentions should still have entries documenting their role
- Missing character entries reduce the guide's completeness and usefulness
- When in doubt, include the character rather than omit them

### Adding New Characters
1. List ALL chapters where the character appears in `appearances`
2. Add `knowledge` entries only when significant new information is revealed
3. Each knowledge entry's `revealedIn` should also be in `appearances`
4. Include ALL named characters, regardless of importance or screen time

### Character Appearances vs Knowledge
- **Appearances**: Every chapter where the character is present
- **Knowledge**: Only chapters where we learn something new
- Example: Harry appears in chapters 1-17, but knowledge updates might only be in chapters 1, 2, 4, 7, etc.

### Quality Checks
- **CRITICAL**: Verify ALL chapters (1 through meta.chapters) have recaps
- **CRITICAL**: Verify ALL named characters are included, no matter how minor
- Verify `appearances` array is complete and accurate
- Ensure `revealedIn` values are subset of `appearances`
- Check that descriptions are spoiler-free for their chapter
- Relationships should reflect what's known at that point
- Review text for any unnamed references that could become character entries

### SEO Checklist for Adding New Series

When adding a new series, ensure SEO is maintained by following these steps:

#### 1. Data File Requirements
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Book Title",        // Used in page titles
    "author": "Author Name",      // Used in structured data
    "chapters": 20,               // Used in descriptions
    "schemaVersion": "2.0",       // Always use v2.0
    "asin": "1234567890"         // Amazon ID for ISBN in structured data
  },
  "characters": { ... },         // More characters = more keywords
  "recaps": { ... }              // Used in meta descriptions
}
```

#### 2. Metadata Optimization
- Book titles should be complete (not abbreviated)
- Include ASIN for ISBN in structured data
- Write compelling chapter recaps (they become meta descriptions)
- Include as many characters as possible (each is a potential search query)

#### 3. After Adding Series Data
1. **Build and test locally**: `npm run build`
2. **Check sitemap generation**: `curl http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml | grep "your-series"`
3. **Verify structured data**: View page source and search for `application/ld+json`
4. **Commit with descriptive message**: Include character count and series name

#### 4. Post-Deployment SEO Tasks
1. **Google Search Console**: Request indexing for new series pages
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check impressions and clicks after 1-2 weeks
3. **Internal Linking**: Consider adding series to related series sections

### SEO Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Weekly Tasks
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors
- Monitor Core Web Vitals scores
- Review search performance for new content
- Submit new high-priority URLs for indexing

#### Monthly Tasks
- Analyze top performing keywords
- Update meta descriptions for underperforming pages
- Review and fix any 404 errors
- Check mobile usability reports

### Important SEO Files

1. **`app/sitemap.ts`** - Sitemap generator (auto-includes all series/books/chapters)
2. **`app/robots.ts`** - Robots.txt configuration
3. **`app/layout.tsx`** - Global metadata and site-wide SEO settings
4. **`components/StructuredData.tsx`** - JSON-LD structured data component
5. **Page-specific metadata** - Each route has `generateMetadata()` function

### Google Search Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add property: `spoilerfreecharacterguide.com`
3. Verify via HTML file (already at `/public/google-site-verification.html`)
4. Submit sitemap: `https://spoilerfreecharacterguide.com/sitemap.xml`
5. Monitor indexing progress and fix any issues

### SEO Quick Wins

1. **Target Long-tail Keywords**: "[Book Name] chapter [X] characters"
2. **Featured Snippets**: Structure content to answer "Who is [character]?"
3. **Series Comparisons**: Create comparison pages between similar series
4. **Seasonal Content**: Highlight series during movie/TV adaptations
5. **User Intent**: Focus on "spoiler-free" and "no spoilers" keywords

## Development Workflow

### Terminal-Based Development with Claude Code
All development is done through the terminal using Claude Code:
- **Development server**: `npm run dev` runs on http://localhost:3000
- **Git workflow**: Make changes → test locally → `git add` → `git commit` → `git push`
- **Testing**: Always verify changes at localhost:3000 before committing
- **Deployment**: Automatic via Vercel on push to main branch
- **Documentation**: ALWAYS update CLAUDE.md with progress after completing and pushing changes for any series/books

### Common Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev     # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build   # Production build
npm start       # Production server

# Git workflow
git status                          # Check what's changed
git add .                          # Stage all changes
git add data/series/book.json     # Stage specific file
git commit -m "feat: description"  # Commit with descriptive message
git push                           # Push to GitHub → triggers Vercel deploy

# Verification commands
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('data/series/book.json')); print(f'Characters: {len(data[\"characters\"])}')"  # Count characters
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/series/book.json')); print('✅ Valid JSON')"  # Validate JSON
```

### Best Practices for Large Character Data Projects

#### 1. Use Task Tool for Large Expansions
For adding 50+ characters, use the Task tool with general-purpose agent:
```
Phase 1: Main characters (20-30 chars)
Phase 2: Supporting characters by faction (30-40 chars)
Phase 3: Minor characters by location (20-30 chars)
Phase 4: Historical/referenced characters (10-20 chars)
```

#### 2. Systematic Expansion Process
```bash
# 1. Check current state
python3 -c "import json; ..."

# 2. Use Task tool for expansion
# 3. Verify new count
python3 -c "import json; ..."

# 4. Commit with descriptive message
git add data/series/book.json
git commit -m "feat: expand Book Name characters (22→307)"
git push

# 5. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION (CRITICAL!)
# Always update CLAUDE.md after pushing changes:
# - Update character counts in "Data Completion Status" section
# - Move series from "Not Started" to appropriate section
# - Update project statistics (total books, characters, etc.)
# - Mark completed series with ✅
```

#### 3. Series-Wide Strategy
- Complete one book fully before moving to next
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress across books
- Verify JSON validity after each major addition
- Commit after each book completion

#### 4. Commit Message Format
```
feat: expand [Book] characters ([old count]→[new count])

Expanded character coverage:
- Phase 1: [description] ([count] characters)
- Phase 2: [description] ([count] characters)
...

## Migration Process

### For Existing Books (v1.0 → v2.0)
1. Run migration helper to convert structure
2. Review auto-generated `appearances` arrays
3. Manually add missing chapter appearances
4. Verify all `revealedIn` values are accurate
5. Update `schemaVersion` to "2.0"

### For New Books
1. Start with v2.0 structure
2. List all character appearances upfront
3. Add knowledge entries as you document each chapter
4. Set `schemaVersion` to "2.0"

## Known Issues & Solutions
- **Inaccurate "In This Chapter"**: Update to v2.0 format with complete `appearances` arrays
- **Legacy data compatibility**: Site handles both formats, but v2.0 is more accurate
- **Missing character appearances**: Review each chapter to ensure all present characters are listed

## Important Notes
- Never regenerate existing character data (only add new)
- Maintain spoiler-free integrity at all times
- `appearances` must be complete for accurate chapter displays
- `knowledge` entries should be cumulative but spoiler-free
- Amazon affiliate links use tag: `spoilerfree-20`
- Contact email: spoilerfreecharacterguide@gmail.com
