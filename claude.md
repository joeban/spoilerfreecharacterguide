## Data Structure
Books are stored in JSON files with:
- Character information revealed progressively by chapter
- Tiered character data (only showing what's known at each point)
- Optional chapter recaps
- Relationships between characters (stored as key-value pairs)

## Known Issues & Solutions
- Build errors with partial JSX updates: Always provide complete component files
- Text contrast on dark backgrounds: Use amber-100/200 with text shadows
- 3D book disconnection: Spine at `left: -35px`, shadow at `right: -25px`
- Chapter selection overwhelming: Use stepper for 20+ chapter books
