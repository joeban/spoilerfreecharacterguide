## Purpose
Track all development decisions, changes, and progress. Each entry should include rationale for future AI assistants.

## 2024-01-XX - Project Initialization

### Decisions Made
1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated code into small, focused modules for AI processing
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, add features incrementally
3. **Data Structure**: JSON-based with schema validation
4. **No Build Process**: Direct browser execution for simplicity

### Rationale
- Small modules fit within AI context windows
- Clear separation of concerns aids AI understanding
- JSON is human and AI readable
- No build process reduces complexity

### Created Files
- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md - Overall architecture
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - This file
- [ ] DATA_SCHEMA.md - JSON structure docs
- [ ] Directory structure

### Next Steps
1. Create base HTML structure
2. Implement modular CSS system
3. Create data loader module
4. Add first book data
