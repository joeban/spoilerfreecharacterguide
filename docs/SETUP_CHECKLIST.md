# Setup Checklist - Chapter Companion

## What This Is
A step-by-step guide to building your website. Check off each box as you complete it.

## Phase 1: Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Folders and Files
Create these on your computer:
- [ ] Create a main folder called `spoilerfreecharacterguide`
- [ ] Inside that, create folders AND add a README.md file to each:
  - [ ] `docs/` folder → add `docs/README.md`
  - [ ] `src/` folder → add `src/README.md`
  - [ ] `data/` folder → add `data/README.md`
  - [ ] `backups/` folder → add `backups/README.md`

**Note**: GitHub needs at least one file in each folder to show the folder!

### 2. Save Documentation Files
Save these files to your `docs` folder:
- [ ] Save PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- [ ] Save DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
- [ ] Save DATA_SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Save SETUP_CHECKLIST.md (this file)

### 3. Create Your Main Webpage
- [ ] Inside the `src` folder, save the index.html file
- [ ] Inside `src`, create a new folder called `css`
- [ ] Save base.css into the `src/css` folder
- [ ] Open index.html in your web browser to test it works

### 4. Upload to GitHub (Simple Way)
Since you already have a repository named `spoilerfreecharacterguide`:
- [ ] Go to github.com and sign in
- [ ] Go to your `spoilerfreecharacterguide` repository
- [ ] Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
- [ ] Drag all your folders into the upload area
- [ ] Scroll down and click "Commit changes" (this saves your work)

### 5. Make It Live on Vercel
If you haven't connected Vercel yet:
- [ ] Go to vercel.com and sign in
- [ ] Click "Add New Project"
- [ ] Select your `spoilerfreecharacterguide` repository
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait about 30 seconds
- [ ] Click "Visit" to see your live website!

If Vercel is already connected:
- [ ] Your site will update automatically when you upload to GitHub!

## How to Make Changes

When you want to update your website:
1. Change files on your computer
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Drag in your changed files
5. Click "Commit changes"
6. Vercel automatically updates your site in about 30 seconds

## What Each Folder Is For

- **docs/** = Instructions and guides (like this file)
- **src/** = Your website code
- **data/** = Information about books and characters
- **backups/** = Copies of your data in case something goes wrong

## If You Get Stuck

1. Make sure all file names match exactly (capitalization matters!)
2. Check that folders are inside the right folders
3. Try refreshing your browser
4. Check that you saved all files

## Simple Progress Tracker

### Today's Goal: Get Basic Site Running
- [ ] Created all folders
- [ ] Saved all documentation files
- [ ] Saved index.html and base.css
- [ ] Uploaded to GitHub
- [ ] Site is live on Vercel

### Tomorrow: Add More Style Files
- [ ] Create layout.css
- [ ] Create components.css
- [ ] Create bookshelf.css
- [ ] Create theme.css

### Later: Add Book Data
- [ ] Create your first book data file
- [ ] Test that it displays correctly

## Remember

- Save your work often
- Upload to GitHub regularly (this is your backup!)
- Small steps are better than big steps
- It's okay to go slow and understand each part
