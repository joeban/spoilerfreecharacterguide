    "1": "Percy Jackson, a troubled 12-year-old with dyslexia and ADHD, attends Yancy Academy. His pre-algebra teacher Mrs. Dodds seems to hate him, and his best friend Grover acts nervous around him. Percy has a bad temper and gets into fights with bullies like Nancy Bobofit.",
    "2": "On a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum, Mrs. Dodds transforms into a monster and attacks Percy. Mr. Brunner tosses Percy a pen that becomes a sword, and Percy destroys Mrs. Dodds. When he returns, everyone acts like Mrs. Dodds never existed, replaced by Mrs. Kerr.",
    "3": "Percy overhears Grover and Mr. Brunner discussing him and something about a 'summer solstice deadline.' Percy goes home to his mother Sally and awful stepfather Gabe. Sally suddenly decides to take Percy to Montauk beach, their special place.",
    "4": "At Montauk, Sally tells Percy the truth: his father was a god, making Percy a half-blood. Monsters can smell him and will hunt him. She's been protecting him, but now he must go to a special camp. A storm brings the Minotaur, who attacks them.",
    "5": "Percy, Sally, and Grover flee toward Camp Half-Blood. The Minotaur catches up and grabs Sally, who dissolves in a golden flash. Enraged, Percy defeats the Minotaur with his bare hands, ripping off its horn. He collapses at the camp border.",
    "6": "Percy wakes up at Camp Half-Blood, healed by nectar and ambrosia. He meets Annabeth, a daughter of Athena, and learns about the camp. Mr. D (Dionysus) is the camp director, and Chiron (Mr. Brunner) runs activities. Percy is placed in the Hermes cabin since his godly parent is unknown.",
    "7": "Percy learns about Camp Half-Blood's history and meets other campers. Luke Castellan, son of Hermes, befriends him and gives him a sword called Backbiter. Percy learns about the different cabins for each god's children and hears about Thalia Grace, a daughter of Zeus who died protecting the camp.",
    "8": "During a game of Capture the Flag, Percy is claimed by Poseidon when he heals from a wound in the creek. This causes uproar since Poseidon is one of the 'Big Three' gods who swore not to have children. Percy moves to Cabin Three, alone.",
    "9": "Chiron explains that Zeus's master bolt has been stolen, and Zeus believes Poseidon (through Percy) took it. Percy could start a war between the gods. Chiron is fired and replaced by Tantalus as camp activities director, though this is quickly reversed when Chiron is proven innocent.",
    "10": "The Oracle gives Percy a prophecy about retrieving Zeus's master bolt from the Underworld. Percy chooses Grover and Annabeth as his quest companions. They have until the summer solstice (just days away) to prevent a war between Zeus and Poseidon.",
    "11": "The trio travels west by bus until monsters attack. They encounter 'Auntie Em' (Medusa) at a roadside curio shop. She tries to turn them to stone, but Percy defeats her using a reflection. He cuts off her head and mails it to Mount Olympus.",
    "12": "At the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the quest continues. Percy is separated from his friends and encounters a chimera and Echidna. The chimera poisons Percy, who falls from the Arch into the Mississippi River, where he discovers he can breathe underwater.",
    "13": "Percy meets water spirits who heal him and give him three pearls from his father Poseidon. The pearls will transport him and two others from any place back to the sea. He reunites with Annabeth and Grover, and they continue west.",
    "14": "The trio encounters Ares, god of war, at a diner. Ares offers them transport west in exchange for retrieving his shield from a water park called Waterland. The park turns out to be a trap set by Hephaestus to catch Ares and Aphrodite together.",
    "15": "At Waterland, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover navigate the Tunnel of Love to find Ares' shield. They're caught in Hephaestus's golden net trap but escape. Ares gives them a backpack with supplies and transport to Las Vegas, though the backpack is secretly trapped.",
    "16": "In Las Vegas, the trio becomes trapped in the Lotus Hotel and Casino, where time moves differently and visitors lose track of the real world. They play games and enjoy luxury while precious days pass in the real world without them realizing it.",
    "17": "Annabeth helps them realize they've lost several days in the Lotus Hotel. They escape and rush to Los Angeles. At a waterbed store, they encounter Procrustes (Crusty), who tries to fit them to his beds by stretching or cutting them. Percy and Annabeth defeat him.",
    "18": "The trio enters the Underworld through DOA Recording Studios. They meet Charon, the ferryman, who transports them across the River Styx to Hades' palace. The realm of the dead is vast and filled with different areas for different types of souls.",
    "19": "Percy confronts Hades, who reveals he didn't steal the master bolt but accuses Percy of stealing both the bolt and his helm of darkness. Hades shows them Sally Jackson, whom he's holding as leverage. The backpack from Ares contains the stolen items - it was a trap.",
    "20": "Percy realizes Luke is the real thief working for Kronos. Using the pearls, Percy transports Sally and Grover to safety but stays to return the helm to Hades. He travels to the beach to confront the real thief and discovers Luke's betrayal and connection to Kronos.",
    "21": "Luke reveals his resentment toward the gods and his service to Kronos, the Titan lord seeking revenge. Percy and Luke fight, but Luke escapes. Ares appears and battles Percy for interfering with his war plans. Percy wounds Ares and claims the master bolt.",
    "22": "Percy travels to Mount Olympus (above the Empire State Building) and returns the master bolt to Zeus. Zeus grudgingly allows Percy to live. Percy returns to camp, where Grover gets his searcher's license to look for Pan, and Percy decides to stay year-round at camp to train."
