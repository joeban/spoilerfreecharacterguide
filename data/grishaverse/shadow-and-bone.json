  "recaps": {
    "1": "Alina Starkov, a sickly mapmaker in the First Army, prepares to cross the dangerous Shadow Fold with her childhood friend Mal Oretsev. The Shadow Fold is a swath of darkness filled with monsters called volcra that divides Ravka. Alina reflects on her childhood at Keramzin orphanage and her deep friendship with Mal.",
    "2": "The skiff carrying Alina's unit is attacked by volcra in the Shadow Fold. When Mal is gravely injured, Alina's desperation triggers a burst of brilliant light that drives away the creatures. The mysterious Darkling, leader of the Grisha, arrives and recognizes Alina as the legendary Sun Summoner.",
    "3": "The Darkling takes Alina to Os Alta, the capital, while she struggles to understand her new powers. She is separated from Mal and brought to the opulent Little Palace where the Grisha live and train. The Darkling explains that she may be powerful enough to destroy the Shadow Fold.",
    "4": "Alina is given luxurious quarters at the Little Palace and meets other Grisha, including the hostile Zoya and the friendly Marie and Nadia. Genya, a beautiful Grisha Tailor, befriends her and improves her appearance. Alina begins to feel overwhelmed by the attention and expectations placed upon her.",
    "5": "Alina begins training with the harsh instructor Baghra, who shows no patience for her struggles to control her power. She also trains in combat with Botkin and learns about Grisha politics from Genya. The Darkling maintains a mysterious but compelling presence in her life.",
    "6": "Alina's training intensifies as Baghra pushes her harder. She begins to make progress with her light-summoning abilities but still struggles with consistency. The other Grisha watch her with a mixture of awe and resentment, particularly Zoya who becomes increasingly hostile.",
    "7": "As Alina grows stronger, she becomes more integrated into Little Palace life but feels increasingly isolated from her past. She longs to see Mal but is told he is on assignment. The Darkling becomes more attentive, and Alina finds herself drawn to him despite her reservations.",
    "8": "Alina is presented at court to the King and Queen of Ravka, where she demonstrates her powers. The vain Queen is more interested in Genya's beauty treatments than Alina's abilities. The Apparat, the King's priest, sees religious potential in Alina's power. Political intrigue swirls around her growing reputation.",
    "9": "Alina's fame spreads throughout Ravka as news of the Sun Summoner reaches the people. She performs public demonstrations of her power, bringing hope to the war-torn nation. However, she feels increasingly like a political tool rather than a person, and her desire to see Mal grows stronger.",
    "10": "Baghra reveals shocking truths about the Darkling's past and his true intentions. She warns Alina that the Darkling plans to use her power for his own dark purposes and that she must flee immediately. Alina learns about Morozova's amplifiers and their connection to the Darkling's centuries-long plan.",
    "11": "Following Baghra's warning, Alina escapes from the Little Palace disguised as a servant. She flees into the countryside, determined to find Mal and warn him about the Darkling's true nature. Her journey is dangerous as she must avoid both the Darkling's agents and enemy forces.",
    "12": "Alina reunites with Mal, and they flee together across Ravka while being pursued by the Darkling's forces. They seek passage across the True Sea but are betrayed and captured. Just as they face execution, they are rescued by the charismatic privateer captain Sturmhond and his crew.",
    "13": "Aboard Sturmhond's ship, Alina and Mal meet Tolya and Tamar, twin Grisha warriors who serve the privateer. Alina learns that Sturmhond knows her true identity and offers to help her find Morozova's amplifiers. She must decide whether to trust this mysterious captain with her secrets.",
    "14": "The group travels to hunt for the legendary Stag, one of Morozova's amplifiers that could greatly enhance Alina's power. They face dangers in the wilderness while being pursued by the Darkling's forces. Alina struggles with the moral implications of killing the magical creature for its power.",
    "15": "They successfully track and find Morozova's Stag in the forest. However, their triumph is short-lived as the Darkling arrives with his forces, having anticipated their destination. A confrontation ensues over who will claim the amplifier, with Alina caught between her desire for power and her conscience.",
    "16": "The Darkling kills the Stag and forces its antler collar around Alina's neck, binding her power to his will. He reveals his true plan to expand the Shadow Fold and use it as a weapon against Ravka's enemies. Alina realizes she has become a prisoner despite her enhanced abilities.",
    "17": "Under the Darkling's control, Alina is forced to demonstrate the expanded Shadow Fold's destructive power by obliterating an enemy stronghold. Hundreds die in the darkness as the Fold consumes everything in its path. Alina is horrified by her unwilling participation in this massacre.",
    "18": "Sturmhond reveals his true identity as Prince Nikolai Lantsov of Ravka, adding a new political dimension to their alliance. Meanwhile, Alina struggles to break free from the Darkling's control over her power through the amplifier. The Apparat's religious movement grows stronger as people view Alina as a saint.",
    "19": "Alina discovers a way to fight back against the Darkling's control by drawing on her connection to the Stag's spirit and her own inner strength. She begins to reclaim her power while planning her resistance against the Darkling. Mal supports her despite the personal cost.",
    "20": "The resistance against the Darkling gains momentum as Alina masters her abilities and breaks free from his control. She reunites with Genya and other allies who have turned against the Darkling after learning of his true nature. A plan forms to stop him from using the Shadow Fold as a weapon.",
    "21": "Alina leads an assault on the Shadow Fold itself, attempting to destroy it and end the Darkling's power source. The battle is fierce as the Darkling commands volcra and his remaining followers. Alina must push her abilities to their limit while her friends fight for their lives.",
    "22": "In the climactic confrontation, Alina faces the Darkling in direct combat within the Shadow Fold. She realizes that destroying him may require sacrificing her own power. The battle threatens to consume everyone as light and darkness clash in an epic struggle.",
    "23": "Alina makes the ultimate sacrifice, using all her power to destroy the Shadow Fold and defeat the Darkling, but loses her abilities in the process. She and Mal escape to start a new life together, free from the burdens of power and politics. Ravka begins to heal as the Fold disappears and hope returns to the land."
