  "recaps": {
    "1": "The four Pevensie children are pulled from a railway station back to Narnia, finding themselves on a deserted island. They discover ruins and realize they're at the remains of Cair Paravel, their old castle. Exploring the treasure chamber, they find their old gifts still intact and realize that many centuries have passed in Narnia since their previous visit.",
    "2": "The children encounter a dwarf named Trumpkin who is about to be drowned by two soldiers. After rescuing him, Trumpkin reluctantly tells them about the current state of Narnia under Telmarine rule. He explains that the talking beasts and Old Narnians are nearly extinct, and that Prince Caspian has blown Queen Susan's magic horn to call for help in his struggle against his uncle King Miraz.",
    "3": "Trumpkin recounts Prince Caspian's story, beginning with his childhood education by his tutor Doctor Cornelius. Cornelius secretly taught Caspian about Old Narnia and revealed that Caspian's father was murdered by Miraz. When Miraz's wife gives birth to a son, making Caspian no longer heir, Cornelius helps Caspian escape the castle with Queen Susan's horn.",
    "4": "Caspian flees through the night and eventually collapses from exhaustion near a dancing circle of fauns and dryads. Two dwarfs, Nikabrik and Trumpkin, along with a badger named Trufflehunter, find him and debate whether to help him. Trufflehunter argues for supporting Caspian as the rightful king, while the skeptical Nikabrik questions trusting any Telmarine.",
    "5": "Caspian lives with the Old Narnians and learns their ways while they gather forces for resistance. More talking beasts and mythical creatures join their cause, including mice led by the valiant Reepicheep. They establish their headquarters at Aslan's How, the ancient mound built over the Stone Table from the first story, and prepare for war against Miraz.",
    "6": "The Pevensie children and Trumpkin begin their journey to find Caspian, but disagree about which route to take. Lucy claims to see Aslan beckoning them in a different direction, but the others don't believe her and choose what seems the easier path. Their chosen route leads them into difficult terrain and they realize they should have trusted Lucy's vision.",
    "7": "After a difficult night, the group continues their journey and encounters hostile Telmarines. They successfully evade capture and eventually meet Caspian's forces at Aslan's How. The reunion between the children and their Old Narnian allies is joyful, and they begin planning strategy for the upcoming battle against Miraz's army.",
    "8": "The war council debates their next move as Miraz's vast army approaches Aslan's How. Some suggest using dark magic and calling upon the White Witch, which Peter and Caspian firmly reject. They decide to send a challenge to Miraz for single combat, hoping to avoid a costly battle that they're unlikely to win with their smaller force.",
    "9": "Peter's challenge reaches Miraz, and the Telmarine lords manipulate the proud king into accepting the single combat by questioning his courage. Meanwhile, Lucy slips away from Aslan's How following Aslan's call, finally meeting the great lion who has been waiting for her. Aslan explains that things never happen the same way twice and that she must trust him completely.",
    "10": "Aslan awakens the spirits of the land - the trees, the river god, and other nature spirits who have long been silent under Telmarine rule. Lucy witnesses this magical awakening as Aslan prepares to restore Narnia to its former glory. Meanwhile, the single combat between Peter and Miraz begins, with the fate of Narnia hanging in the balance.",
    "11": "The duel between Peter and King Miraz continues with both fighters showing skill and determination. During a break in combat, treacherous Telmarine lords murder Miraz and blame the Narnians for his death, using this as an excuse to attack. The battle becomes general, with Caspian's smaller force fighting desperately against the overwhelming Telmarine army.",
    "12": "Just when all seems lost, Aslan arrives with Lucy and an army of awakened trees and nature spirits. The Telmarines flee in terror before this supernatural force, and many are driven to the river where they surrender. The battle ends in complete victory for Caspian and the Old Narnians, with Narnia finally free from Telmarine oppression.",
    "13": "After the victory celebration, Aslan crowns Prince Caspian as the rightful King of Narnia in a great ceremony. The talking beasts and Old Narnians rejoice as their land is restored. Aslan deals justly with the defeated Telmarines, offering them a choice to stay in Narnia under Caspian's rule or return to the human world from which their ancestors originally came.",
    "14": "Many Telmarines choose to return to their ancestral world through a magical door created by Aslan. The Pevensie children realize they too must return to their own world, as they are now too old to keep coming back to Narnia. Aslan explains that Peter and Susan will not return again, but Edmund and Lucy may come back once more.",
    "15": "The Pevensie children say their emotional farewells to their Narnian friends and to Aslan himself. They pass through the magical doorway and find themselves back at the railway station where their adventure began, with only a few minutes having passed in their world. They reflect on their experiences and the knowledge that their time as kings and queens of Narnia has truly ended."
