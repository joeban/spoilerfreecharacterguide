Shift begins to impersonate Aslan's voice, claiming the lion (Puzzle in disguise) is Aslan. Meanwhile, King Tirian of Narnia hears disturbing reports that Aslan has returned and is selling talking horses into slavery and allowing the sacred trees to be cut down.",
    "2": "King Tirian and his unicorn friend Jewel investigate the reports and find Calormene soldiers cutting down the sacred grove of talking trees under orders from 'Aslan.' Horrified by this blasphemy, they kill two Calormenes in their anger. Tirian sends Jewel to gather loyal Narnians while he seeks counsel from Roonwit the centaur, who reads dire portents in the stars.",
    "3": "Roonwit the centaur warns King Tirian that the stars foretell disaster and that the Aslan at Stable Hill is not the true Aslan. However, Roonwit is shot by a Calormene arrow before he can elaborate. Tirian realizes he and Jewel acted rashly in killing the Calormenes and decides they must surrender to Shift's 'Aslan' for judgment, despite their doubts about the lion's authenticity.",
    "4": "King Tirian and Jewel surrender to Shift and are bound to a tree as prisoners. Tirian is horrified to see 'Aslan' (Puzzle in the lion skin) and realizes this cannot be the true Aslan. In desperation, Tirian calls out to the children from another world, asking Aslan to send them help if they ever were his friends. His call for aid echoes into our world, seeking the Friends of Narnia.",
    "5": "Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole appear in Narnia, called by Tirian's plea for help. They rescue the king from his bonds and learn about the situation with the false Aslan. Together with Tirian, they begin planning how to rescue Jewel and expose Shift's deception. They realize they are few against many enemies but are determined to fight for the true Narnia.",
    "6": "The small group of heroes witnesses one of Shift's gatherings, where the false Aslan makes an appearance before the confused Narnian creatures. They see how Shift has allied with the Calormenes and how many creatures are being deceived. Ginger the cat emerges as another schemer, while some dwarfs begin to grow suspicious of the false Aslan's behavior and commands.",
    "7": "A group of dwarfs, led by Griffle, reject both the false Aslan and King Tirian, declaring they will trust no one but themselves. However, Poggin the dwarf remains loyal and joins Tirian's band. They rescue Jewel from his captivity, and their small force grows slightly as a few loyal creatures join them. The situation becomes more desperate as the enemy forces grow stronger.",
    "8": "Rishda Tarkaan reveals his cynical atheism to Ginger, admitting he believes in neither Tash nor Aslan but sees religion as a useful tool for controlling people. Meanwhile, Tirian's band is joined by more loyal creatures including talking horses, dogs, and various woodland animals. They prepare for what seems to be a hopeless battle against overwhelming odds, but remain determined to fight for truth and freedom.",
    "9": "The heroes make a nighttime raid to rescue some of the enslaved talking horses. They succeed in freeing several animals, but the enemy forces are alerted to their presence. Rishda Tarkaan increases security around the stable and begins preparing for a final confrontation. The small band of loyal Narnians knows their time for guerrilla tactics is running out.",
    "10": "Shift becomes increasingly nervous and dependent on alcohol as he realizes his deception is unraveling. Rishda Tarkaan effectively takes control, using Shift as a puppet while pursuing his own agenda of conquest. The stable becomes the center of power, with the false Aslan supposedly dwelling inside. Tensions build as both sides prepare for the inevitable final confrontation at Stable Hill.",
    "11": "Ginger proposes the blasphemous idea that Tash and Aslan are the same being, calling this combined deity 'Tashlan.' This satisfies both the Calormenes and the deceived Narnians, allowing the deception to continue. Rishda Tarkaan embraces this lie as it serves his purposes, while Shift loses more control over the situation. The false theology spreads among the confused creatures, making the deception even more insidious.",
    "12": "Ginger enters the stable to prove there's nothing supernatural inside, but emerges as an ordinary, non-talking cat, apparently stripped of his speech by some terrible encounter. The real demon Tash has appeared inside the stable, summoned by the blasphemous worship. The situation becomes supernatural and terrifying as the false gods begin to manifest their power, bringing supernatural horror to the deception.",
    "13": "The final battle begins at Stable Hill. King Tirian leads his small band of loyal creatures against the much larger force of Calormenes and deceived Narnians. The fighting is fierce, and many brave creatures fall on both sides. Puzzle is finally freed from the lion skin and reveals the truth about the deception, but it may be too late to change the outcome of the battle.",
    "14": "As the battle rages, the true Aslan appears at last. He commands Father Time to wake up and end the world. The stars begin falling from the sky, the sun goes out, and time itself begins to end. All the creatures of Narnia are called to judgment as the old world passes away. The stable door becomes a gateway between the dying world and something far greater beyond.",
    "15": "Aslan calls all creatures to judgment, separating those who loved him from those who feared him. The cynical dwarfs refuse to believe even in the real Aslan, trapping themselves in their own darkness. Emeth the Calormene, despite his foreign faith, is welcomed by Aslan for his sincere seeking of truth. Rishda Tarkaan faces the consequences of his blasphemy as Tash claims him. The great separation begins between those who choose light and those who choose darkness.",
    "16": "Those who passed through the stable door find themselves in the true Narnia - Aslan's own country, of which the old Narnia was only a shadow. They are reunited with all the heroes of Narnia's history and discover that they died in a railway accident in our world. The Friends of Narnia (except Susan, who lost her way) are all present, along with their parents. This is the beginning of the real story, where every chapter is better than the one before, in the land where no good thing is ever lost and every joy lasts forever."
