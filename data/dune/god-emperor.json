    "1": "Three and a half millennia into his reign, the God Emperor Leto II rules from his palace on Arrakis. No longer human, he has become a massive sandworm-human hybrid. His empire maintains peace through absolute tyranny, preventing war but also stagnation. The latest Duncan Idaho ghola serves as his companion.",
    "10": "Leto's rule faces internal tensions as rebels led by his descendant Siona Atreides work against his government. The Ixians send Ambassador Hwi Noree, designed to be irresistible to Leto, beginning a relationship that reawakens his human emotions.",
    "20": "Duncan's ghola memories begin awakening, creating internal conflict about his eternal servitude. Siona's rebellion continues as she demonstrates her rare ability to remain hidden from prescient vision, making her both dangerous and valuable.",
    "30": "Leto's relationship with Hwi deepens, providing him with genuine companionship for the first time in millennia. He begins testing Siona more directly, recognizing that she may be key to the next phase of the Golden Path.",
    "40": "The God Emperor starts preparing for the end of his reign, understanding that his death is necessary for humanity's future. Siona begins to grasp the true scope of Leto's plan, while Duncan fully awakens to his multiple lifetimes of service.",
    "50": "Tensions escalate as various factions position themselves for the post-Leto era. The God Emperor allows events to unfold according to his prescient visions, knowing that his death will trigger the Scattering - humanity's explosion across the universe.",
    "60": "The conspiracy against Leto reaches its climax. Hwi Noree dies in the conflict, her death serving as the final catalyst for Leto's willingness to end his reign. Siona leads the rebellion that will free humanity from his tyranny.",
    "67": "Leto II dies in the Idaho River, his sandtrout skin dissolving and returning to the desert. His death ends 3,500 years of enforced peace and begins the Scattering. Siona inherits leadership of humanity, while Duncan survives to help guide the transition. The God Emperor's sacrifice ensures humanity will spread across the universe, too scattered for any single force to ever control again."
