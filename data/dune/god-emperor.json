    "1": "Three and a half millennia into his reign, the God Emperor Leto II rules from his palace on Arrakis. No longer human, he has become a massive sandworm-human hybrid weighing several tons. His empire maintains peace through absolute tyranny, preventing war but also technological and cultural stagnation.",

    "25": "Political tensions increase as various factions sense that major changes are approaching. The Tleilaxu, Spacing Guild, and other groups position themselves for advantage in whatever upheaval may come, not realizing they are playing roles in Leto's plan.",
    "28": "Siona's rebellion gains momentum as she demonstrates leadership qualities and moral courage. Her ability to inspire others while remaining invisible to prescient detection makes her uniquely qualified for the role Leto has in mind for her.",

    "58": "Hwi dies in the conflict, her death removing the last emotional anchor keeping Leto tied to existence. With her gone, the God Emperor finally releases his hold on life and power, allowing the conspiracy to succeed as he has always planned.",
