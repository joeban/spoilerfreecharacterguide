    "43": "The great exodus begins as Sheeana, Duncan, the Tleilaxu Master Scytale, Rebecca, and other carefully chosen companions escape on a no-ship to preserve Bene Gesserit knowledge and genetics among the scattered worlds. Meanwhile, Murbella assumes command of the merged organization to face the Unknown Enemy. The series concludes with humanity's survival ensured through two parallel paths: the political merger creating strength through unity, and the exodus preserving essence through diversity. As the escapees journey into the unknown carrying millennia of hard-won human wisdom, they represent both the continuation of ancient traditions and hope for humanity's future among the stars."
